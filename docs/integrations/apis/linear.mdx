## Authentication

Linear supports Personal API Key and OAuth. You can use either of these to authenticate with Linear.

### Personal API Key

You can create a Personal API Key in your [Linear API Settings](https://linear.app/settings/api).

```ts
import { Linear } from "@trigger.dev/linear";

//this will use the passed in API key (defined in your environment variables)
const linear = new Linear({
  id: "linear",
  apiKey: process.env["LINEAR_API_KEY"],
});
```

### OAuth

```ts
import { Linear } from "@trigger.dev/linear";

//this will use OAuth
const linear = new Linear({
  id: "linear",
});
```


## Triggers and Tasks

Once you have set up a Linear client, you can use it to create triggers and tasks.
