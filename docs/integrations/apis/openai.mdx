## Installing the OpenAI packages

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

To use the OpenAI API with Trigger.dev, you'll need an API Key from OpenAI.
If you don't have one yet, you can obtain it from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "@trigger.dev/openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  id: "openai",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Tasks

Once you have set up a OpenAI client, you can use it to create tasks.
