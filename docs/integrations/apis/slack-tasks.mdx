Tasks are executed after the job is triggered and are the main building blocks of a job. You can string together as many tasks as you want.

## All tasks

### `postMessage`

Post a message to a channel. [Official Slack Docs](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage)

```ts example.ts
// Send a Slack message using the io.slack.postMessage function
await io.slack.postMessage("post message", {
  // Specify the target channel by providing its ID
  channel: "<your-channel-id>",
  // Set the text content of the message
  text: "<your-slack-message>",
});
```

## Example Usage

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "send-slack-message",
  name: "Send a Slack message",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "send.slack.message",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    slack,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const response = await io.slack.postMessage("post message", {
      channel: "<your-channge-id>",
      text: "<your-slack-message>",
    });
  },
});
```

## How to post rich messages to Slack

Use their [Block kit builder](https://api.slack.com/block-kit), and then use the `blocks` property to send the message.

To see this in action, check out our 'Daily Slack alert for Linear issues' [example job](https://trigger.dev/showcase/jobs/linearIssuesDailySlackAlert).

```ts linearIssuesDailySlackAlert.ts
...
await io.slack.postMessage("post message", {
      channel: process.env.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID!,
      // Include text for notifications and blocks to get a rich Slack message in the channel
      text: `You have ${inProgressIssues.nodes.length} 'In Progress' issues in Linear!`,
      // Create rich Slack messages with the Block Kit builder https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/
      blocks: inProgressIssues.nodes.flatMap((issue) => [
        {
          type: "section",
          text: {
            type: "mrkdwn",
            text: `‚è≥ *${issue.title}*`,
          },
          accessory: {
            type: "button",
            text: {
              type: "plain_text",
              text: "View issue",
              emoji: true,
            },
            value: "click_me_123",
            url: issue.url,
            action_id: "button-action",
          },
        },
        {
          type: "divider",
        },
      ]),
    });
  },
});
```
